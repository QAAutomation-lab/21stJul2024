/*
its similar to a method but,
    * its name should be same as class
    * its won't have return type so won;t return any value

its is used to initialize non-static member of the class into the object memory

type:
   1. default constructor - written by java compiler
   		only when class doesn't have any constructor
   		this constructor won't be having any parameter and its body will be empty
   2. user defined constructor
